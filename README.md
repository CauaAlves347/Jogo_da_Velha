# Tic_tac_Toe
First attempt at creating a game, I play this tic-tac-toe style

The game has two players, they will make their moves on an N x N table, using the coordinates indicated at the beginning of the code, example: a1, b4, etc.

The game ends when all spaces on the board are filled or one of the two players manages to form a line of 3 characters, X or O, regardless of the size of the board.
